@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add’l fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@AmericanAir I did
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!

@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80

@AmericanAir can you please connect these two reservations together and also add a child in a lap. KEVOLT and SOZLDJ march 1. Thanks
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
