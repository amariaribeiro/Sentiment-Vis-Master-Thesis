@JetBlue I hope so because I fly very often and would hate to change airlines.
@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah, GA
@JetBlue They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
"@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!"
@JetBlue update on Flight 462 would be appreciated when you have time, thanks
@JetBlue check DM please :)
@JetBlue Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek
@JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@JetBlue ’s Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
"@JetBlue Submitted, hoping for quick decision, tied to another donation we just received:

@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.
@JetBlue thank you for the information.
@JetBlue did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24

@JetBlue just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it.
"@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our ""on time"" flight 1170 out of MCO"
@JetBlue Not for the dates or destination I'm headed 😔
@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
@JetBlue great.
@JetBlue thanks great recap. I wouldn't have been able to sleep!  I was nervous the bad guy was getting away. 😉
@JetBlue flying w/ infant for the 1st time, can I bring a canister of powder formula for a carry on and/or use my plastic formula divider?
@JetBlue flight 117. proud to fly Jet Blue!
@JetBlue awesome, thanks! on hold now.
@JetBlue I'm not sure if you can do anything to help me with that, but if you can that'd be great.
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.

@JetBlue I was returning from @FoodNetwork #SOBEWFF so I had limited carry on space in my tummy. Next flight I'll try that snack!

@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound

@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.

@JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can't join mine for a year???  Help me fix please.
@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.

@JetBlue try harder. Take a winners attitude to your work.
@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V” this happened
@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?

@JetBlue How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I'm liking your international options...
@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet.

@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay.
@JetBlue mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!!

"@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-"

@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?
@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...

@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9

@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it 😃
@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!
@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then

@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
"@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not."
@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
"@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day."
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
“@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.” Me and JetBlue are #BFF 🙏
@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue all day
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ☺️
@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?
@JetBlue finally! Finally!
@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
@JetBlue flight 2008
@JetBlue Pittsburgh
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
"@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)"
"@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?"
@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
@JetBlue woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX
@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@JetBlue What confirmation number?
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock
@JetBlue follow for DM please
@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?
@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! 🙌✈️
@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
@JetBlue love it as always!
"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue
@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
@JetBlue is there wifi on he plain
"@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!"
@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
"@JetBlue wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX&gt;JFK tomorrow. Can you help?"
@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@JetBlue hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan 🌴
@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ☺️✈️
@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
@JetBlue you guys rock!
@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍
@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
"@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much!"
@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
@JetBlue of course I am!!✈️
@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
"@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)"
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
"@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky"
@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
"@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected"
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!” Thank you!
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
"@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?"
@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
His name is Enzo 😊 RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg
"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
@JetBlue Promo Watch Phone $33 at Amazon check http://t.co/leNaOwFyvU
@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
@JetBlue Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H
"@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too."
@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@JetBlue don't I always?
@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board
@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?
@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
"“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)” Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;)"
@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
@JetBlue 795 to Austin
@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
@JetBlue thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue http://t.co/5Db9eSBNzG
@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU
@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
@JetBlue flight16?
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!
@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@JetBlue have a cpap machine for sleep apnea. Is this OK to carry on if I also have a small bag for clothes?
@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
@JetBlue Charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! http://t.co/sEUlpvfn95
@JetBlue thx, social media person!
@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours
"@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!"
@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!

What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy
@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
"@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart."
@JetBlue done, thank you!

@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.
@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks.
@JetBlue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?

@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
@JetBlue great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline.

@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?

@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.

"@JetBlue I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue"
@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything.
@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
@JetBlue status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow?
@jetblue what good with the inflight WiFi?
@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.
@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel

@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
@JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours.

@JetBlue thanks...
.@JetBlue i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum.
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
@JetBlue question, flying for the 1st time with my 16mont old son...do I need to bring anything for him? Birth certificate/S.S. card etc?
.@JetBlue process begins 6:48
.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
.@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
@JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!

@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
@JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 💔
@JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts?
@JetBlue maybe announce the delay so we don't sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off
@JetBlue Please come to Indianapolis!

@JetBlue I have more flights that I'd love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. Is there a historical limit?
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
@JetBlue Thanks for the reminder of a few older flights I'd taken and the easy access to add points to my new JB account! Awesome service.

"@JetBlue Awww thank you B6! Glad to hear it!  Made my day! &amp; one last question do you have any idea what tail is operating flt 606 2maro? :)"
@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
@JetBlue in the sky on flight 833 from BOS to SFO. Awesome crew! Helene rocks!
@JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
@JetBlue we are bringing 2 guitars. can we bring them as carry on?
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
@JetBlue I LOVE JET BLUE!
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@JetBlue So anything found while cleaning the plane in DC would be at the baggage office, even something small?
@JetBlue Can I bring my dog on board?
@NinaDavuluri We think it's a treat to have you onboard! Enjoy your flight. 💙
@JetBlue @NinaDavuluri 😃cool
@JetBlue Maybe I'll just go to Cleveland instead.
@JetBlue yes! Always a treat to fly with you guys! 😊✈️
@JetBlue Thank you. I really would have preferred Jet Blue. You guys have the best seats in the business.
@JetBlue Hi. I'm trying to find a flight to the Middle East.
@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
"@JetBlue here in Austin I saw the water bottles &amp; snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! Im so Flight Booking Problems my next flight with you!"
@JetBlue no, they're too busy being awesome and trying to get us out ASAP. I'll deal.
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔
@JetBlue any idea when November-December 2015 travel opens up?

@JetBlue excellent. you guys are the best
@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
"@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates."
@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
"@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS."
@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I 💙 you!
@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
"@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?"
@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
"@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are..."
@JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E
@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ☕✈👍
@JetBlue awesome, thanks!

@JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!
@JetBlue keep going back and forth with being able to board and then not. But great agents in savannah!
"@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but ""by"" means ""within the extent or period of; during"" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary"
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@JetBlue 1st flight of the morning, flying with a toddler. Will the plane be heated to a comfortable temp before boarding starts. #ItsCold
@JetBlue That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.
"@JetBlue I want to enter the family pooling contest, it says ""by 2/19"" on the website, can I please enter still!"
@JetBlue Vegas, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia so far! I'm a very frequent business traveler.
@JetBlue and of course that was supposed to say Logan, not login
@JetBlue you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline!
@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
😢😢 RT“@JetBlue: @Peaches275 Oh no! Unfortunately, the code must be entered at the time of purchase in order to qualify for the points.”
@JetBlue quick question, to pay for a second bag, do I have to do it online or can I do it at the airport?
"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
@JetBlue Hi. How do I claim points on a 1800-flowers order after I purchased? I totally forgot to put in the promo code.
@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
@jetblue How long ago can a trip have taken place for me to still get credit if I didn't apply my TrueBlue # when I booked?
@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly
@jetblue I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab.
@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
@JetBlue:  Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@JetBlue excited for my first flight w/ you today! It's delayed though- can you give me the 411? Flight number 989 from Boston to DC
@JetBlue what is the Mosiac 800 #?
@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)"
@JetBlue should I check in my awesome bag on my flight or carry it on... Decisions...
@JetBlue I can't. I don't have acces to a phone rn. My iPhone broke. :/ would rather change it now then Late Flightr.
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
.@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my “only” airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :(

@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
@JetBlue thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA
@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!

@JetBlue short stop at JFK before IAD
@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
@JetBlue Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously?
@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
@JetBlue thanks
@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
"@JetBlue @NHLBruins repping the Bruins in Cleveland at Rock n Roll HOF &amp; The Christmas Story house #JetBlueBruins http://t.co/JKnWuGJ778"
@JetBlue No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked.
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.
@JetBlue My card company and I explained the issue over the phone when I was in Mexico. I purchased a new ticket over the phone.
"@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it."
@JetBlue my credit card company accidentally marked my jet blue tickets as fraud, then corrected their mistake and reposted the money.
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
@JetBlue flight attendant Wendi on Flt 127 on 2/17, Newark to Orlando.  👍👍
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
"@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)"
@JetBlue Just looking to arrange for a nice flight from SEA to LA-ish and comparing the cost to something more direct from YVR.
@JetBlue Sent my suggestion and comments via the link provided..
@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.

@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
@JetBlue What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee

@JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying.
@JetBlue great flight and crew! Flight 51 from BOS to MCO
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@JetBlue That's why I love JetBlue! #truebluemember4life

@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain

@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
@JetBlue you guys are lucky I love you
@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.
@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of

@JetBlue gorgeous day, hope the flight back tomorrow AM is just as pleasant! Thanks
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!

@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it

@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@JetBlue offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp.

@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :(
@JetBlue is definitely my new favorite airline.

@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.
@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
