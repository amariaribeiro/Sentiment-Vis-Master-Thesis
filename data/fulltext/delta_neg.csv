@JetBlue They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
"@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!"
@JetBlue Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek
@JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@JetBlue ’s Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.
@JetBlue ive tried on my phone and laptop :(
"@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more👺"
@JetBlue just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it.
"@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our ""on time"" flight 1170 out of MCO"
@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
@JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.
"@JetBlue can't book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in ""Verified by Visa"" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw"
@JetBlue luggage fees? won't b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter
@JetBlue it's poop and barely works
@JetBlue your wifi is a lie and i hate you
@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
"@jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting ""We are not able to sign you in"" msg."
@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
"@JetBlue Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen!"
"@JetBlue Need your help. I'm moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won't seem to let me. Am I missing something?"
@JetBlue 's Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual!  #jetbluehatesbtv
@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!
@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising.
@JetBlue I just DM'd you!
@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
@JetBlue, I've experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr
@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
@JetBlue the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
@JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
@JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can't join mine for a year???  Help me fix please.
@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.
@JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.
@JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board
@JetBlue that's not a answer!
See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4
".@JetBlue Navigating through 2 rebooks due to flu &amp; ice to visit my Mother.  Your CS reps have been so very helpful, patient and friendly."
@JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time.
@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
"@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for ""weather"" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?"
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
@JetBlue we're home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon?
"@JetBlue Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old...
 #damn"
"@JetBlue flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can't seem to rebook me. They can't even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted."
@JetBlue does transferring trueblue points within family pooling members cost $? This is after having set up contribution-to-pool already.
"@JetBlue Gotcha... but ""lessening the delay"" ... that part's not happening, right?"

STOP @JetBlue
"@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?"
@JetBlue App still saying I can't DM you...
@JetBlue once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
@JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
@JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie
@jetblue I hate you for this 😒 https://t.co/g4WwR6VBRQ
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag

@JetBlue We had some major plane-wide DirectTV issues yesterday. System kept being reset by crew member.
@JetBlue Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
Sorry for unfollowing, @JetBlue
@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated

@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
"@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look ""normal"" ????"
@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
"@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today."
"@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right."
@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
"@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!"
"@JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised."
"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
"@JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a ""Customer Experience"" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?"
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
"@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset"
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
"@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right."
@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening.
@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒
@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet.
@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better
"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
"@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better"
@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people.
"@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was ""There is nothing we can do"" idk if that's what you mean"
@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
"@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-"
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
@JetBlue any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report"""
@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
"@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i"

"@JetBlue 👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)"
@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi???
@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"

@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!
"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"

"@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant"
@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
"@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not."
"@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day."
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue all day
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2

@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
"@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?"
@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
"@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much!"
@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
"@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky"
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
"@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected"
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
"@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?"
@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
"@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too."
@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board
@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
@JetBlue  hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear..
@JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible
@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you...
@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate.
@JetBlue why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?!
@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
@JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please?
@JetBlue we need an ETA please
@jetblue fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free
@JetBlue  I'm at 4:05  will be nasty in Boston. Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted?
@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.
@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks.
@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
@JetBlue suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don't honor #badairline
@JetBlue how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed
@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?
@JetBlue my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can't confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int
@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??
@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this
@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
@JetBlue I am But Your customer service is Brutal.
@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies
@JetBlue Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood
@JetBlue thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren't so cushy here...!
@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
@jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet.
@JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
@JetBlue can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch..
@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!
@JetBlue Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info.
@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
@JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC
@JetBlue can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children
@JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago.
@JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.
@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
@JetBlue she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎
@JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs.
"@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on"
@JetBlue figured it out 4 flight 2morrow. Hard to believe with oil so low, and the killing u make that even part of a hotel can't be comp'd
@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes
@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
@JetBlue didn't find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found
@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
@JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me.
@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!
@JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail
@JetBlue no more than half an hour wait. It's unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this
@JetBlue how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait
@JetBlue we've been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info?
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage
@JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone
@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything.
@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.
@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel
@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
@JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours.
@JetBlue at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled
"@JetBlue I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today."
@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
@JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘
@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
@JetBlue *cough* #awkward!
@JetBlue you guys need live chat.
@JetBlue it was but obviously it wasn't linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it.
@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us
@JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue
@JetBlue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh!
@JetBlue that sucks. Oh well.
@JetBlue she's standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy
@JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
@JetBlue there's is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true.
@JetBlue can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes
@JetBlue why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous.
@JetBlue it seems I never received an ID, just a password.
@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!
@JetBlue yes, We have de baggage claim, I'm so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us 😞 please we need That baggage
@JetBlue my mom's baggage is lost, in fly 1557 fort lauderdale-Bogotá today, Colombian employees treated us badly , need help please
@JetBlue No changes made. My son's pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted 😢
"@JetBlue You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!"
@JetBlue the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30
@JetBlue that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in
@JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me
@JetBlue I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a
@JetBlue flying to Denver March 1st and my flight itenary keeps getting changed what the heck...booked the trip 3 months ago
@jetblue had me on hold foreverrrrrr
@JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw.
"@JetBlue waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this?"
@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
“@JetBlue: @benjaminokeefe Thanks for including us on your tour! Did you pack your winter coat?”Unfortunately yes ❄️⛄️ #WereNotinCaliAnymore
@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
@JetBlue It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)
"@JetBlue yeah that's all been done. Define ""incidentals""? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?"
@JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@JetBlue you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue
@JetBlue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous
@JetBlue you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
"@JetBlue says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;)"
@JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best.
@JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry!
@JetBlue why won't the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin?
@JetBlue Late Flight again lost almost 3 hours of my bay area weekend not to mention two hours of unnecessary vacation time from work.  #flt348
@JetBlue yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it's your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially
@JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
@JetBlue this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat?
@JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay
@JetBlue I appreciate the speedy response. But the longer you delay the more inconvenience you put on your customers. Please nix change fee!

@JetBlue thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
@JetBlue I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
@JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?
"@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land"
@JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would've lost it there around 445pm MT
@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
@JetBlue any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay?
.@JetBlue i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum.
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
.@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
@JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!
@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
@JetBlue flight1407, it's been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning
"@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?"
@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats
@JetBlue Jan 5? That's not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt
@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
@JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 💔
@JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts?
@JetBlue maybe announce the delay so we don't sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off
@JetBlue flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight
.@JetBlue Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF
@JetBlue Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere
"@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 👎"
Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue
@JetBlue can't seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP
@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?
"@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining"
@JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue
@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International.
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Ur60Un86gy
@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
"@JetBlue I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done?"
@JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening's is starting w delays. Why?
@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue
@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating.
@JetBlue something they're not telling us (2)
@JetBlue we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof
@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me
@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.
@JetBlue 290 to Boston
@JetBlue I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
"@JetBlue when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt;"
@JetBlue sorry to report we are stuck on Tarmac.. Being held so #notwheelsup
I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
@JetBlue appreciate what you've done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling.
Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue
"@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.
Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance."
@JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided
@JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue.
@JetBlue don't just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. .
@JetBlue I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/
"@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :("
@JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I'll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer
"@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated"
@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!
@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
@JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?
@JetBlue your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too
@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
@JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX
@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
"@JetBlue - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy"
@JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
@JetBlue and stranded passengers aren't being helped to get another flight?
@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
@JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight
@JetBlue #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
"@JetBlue the one man in baggage office says ""I dunno"". HELP"
@JetBlue where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice
@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
@JetBlue service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW
@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.
@JetBlue #669 stewardesses can't work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues @anku @yaffasolin
@JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet!
@JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
"@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email..."
@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired
@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
@JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔
@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
@JetBlue shut up an turn on the tvs/music
@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
"@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS."
@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
"@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are..."
@JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E
@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
@JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!
"@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but ""by"" means ""within the extent or period of; during"" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary"
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
@JetBlue No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked.
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.
"@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it."
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.
@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
@JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux?
@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
@JetBlue What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee
@JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying.
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@JetBlue Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ?
"@JetBlue - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable"
@JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account
talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
".@JetBlue @ZKatcher 😂😂😂😂😂OMG. Bored &amp; read through this convo.. Seems like JetBlue is on point."
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us #jetblue #fixthis #ripoff @ZKatcher @bretharold
@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.

@JetBlue please get service started at @triflight and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?
@JetBlue i am here - what is your resolution?
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
@JetBlue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue
@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
@JetBlue I'm on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap
@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.
@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of
@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
"@JetBlue claims w/ customer protection they ""will notify customers of delays, Cancelled Flightlations and diversions."" #NotTRUE http://t.co/3oq1T4ohjl"
"@JetBlue if there is a ""processing error"" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest"
"@JetBlue tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY @ airport  22 hours before my flight  #RIPOFF #NoSupport"
"@JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed ""to mail written letter"" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8"
@JetBlue No, he didn't have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep?
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@JetBlue the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It's staticy #ithelpsabit
@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
@JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢
@JetBlue case making jackass out me we not allowed do favor say?get right care less!me no out of vacation now true see!am!peter scott
@JetBlue False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights.
@jetblue rqstd upgrade to mint at LAX and was told no because i used points! Why turn down $1600 bcz I used points? #trueblue
@jetblue trading customer experience for short term $$. So sad for this (previous?) loyal customer. https://t.co/dFmvmiBH4x
@JetBlue flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop

@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/h6cE3mWCqj
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
@JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago.
@JetBlue Flight 1951. Bags haven't come and we landed 30 minutes ago.
"@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly"
@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good.
@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever
@JetBlue If it was simply a minor mechanical, why would they say that?
@JetBlue can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?😢
"@JetBlue My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if ""the passengers really knew what was going on"" and the attendant said no."
"@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time."
@JetBlue it says it is now 9:58 you owe me
@JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
@JetBlue They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago.
@JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay.
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj

@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM
@JetBlue why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?
@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls!
@jetblue waiting for flt 105 to Chicago. Why hasn't aircraft left buffalo yet?
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
@JetBlue C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@JetBlue Flight is 100% full.
@JetBlue Walked down the hall to Carousel 8...found all bags sitting there. Still no words from crew...signage still not updated
@JetBlue Headphone jack not working on my flight.
@JetBlue Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
@JetBlue #JetBlueBOS What's up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS?  Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating.

@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
@JetBlue I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue
@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 😩
@JetBlue while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option
"@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out"
@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
@JetBlue Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle!
@JetBlue so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue @airlinequality #skytrax http://t.co/tU9JX2jaZN

@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR
"@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?"
@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
@JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don't help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note.
@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
@JetBlue only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can't just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason.
@JetBlue keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before
@JetBlue can't change it. True blue points and I can't get to a phone
@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
@JetBlue I'm trying to add my 2012 flights to my Badges account but i don't see an option. Help plz?
@JetBlue I cheated on you, and I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever
@JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers
@JetBlue what's going on with 1171 LGA-FLL..poor to no communication from gate agents??
@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!
@JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)
"@JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3)"
@JetBlue Oh no! I thought it did. :(
@JetBlue nope. None to be found
@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.
@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here.
@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me
@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me
@JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
@JetBlue but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason.
@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
@JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
@JetBlue Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn't bring it on.
"@JetBlue last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy"
"@JetBlue Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV."
@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
@JetBlue Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working...
@JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about
@JetBlue WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO
@JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs?
@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue 😔😓😤
It's on me, @JetBlue! That's not what you said last night, though... :(
@JetBlue @Cinnabon the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky
@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.
@JetBlue spoken to 2 reps. Once I'm allowed to check my bag and through the TSA checkpoint, I guarantee I will be talking to someone.
@JetBlue and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off?
@JetBlue got txt  40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived @ JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight.
@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
@JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A.
@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
@JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I'm giving you a second chance. I'm just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home.
@JetBlue waited for 15 min then got disconnect
@JetBlue is I can't make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone
@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
@JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo
@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
@JetBlue no news here at the gate. What are my options?
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@JetBlue  no ... I am guessing I have to call someone
@JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
@JetBlue #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn't boarded. What's today's excuse and how am I gonna get to work?
@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
@JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.
@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it
@JetBlue disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation
@JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated.
@JetBlue ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue
@JetBlue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk
@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.
@JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service
@JetBlue 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it's 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail
"@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass"
@JetBlue honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/
@JetBlue bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!!
"@JetBlue I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song ""I'm Blue"" while flying on JetBlue."
"@JetBlue flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time, &amp; greeting me at my seat (yes it's gum &amp; garbage): http://t.co/n9hmcrJChb"
@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
@JetBlue I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@JetBlue offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp.
@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat
@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
@JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me!
@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
@JetBlue flight from DCA to BOS has no heat #OhNo #BundleUp #Leastthebeverageswillbecold
“@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that's not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That's a certain #fail Fix it plz.
@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number.
@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?
@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :(
@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
@JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats
@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.
@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
"@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2"
@JetBlue tell your employees that!
@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail
@JetBlue ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm
@JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note
@JetBlue Guys, really bad @JetBlue #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold....
@JetBlue #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now Cancelled Flightled! No new time! No call back
@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
@JetBlue ticket issued whilst delivering your customers.
@JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security
Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.
@JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?
@JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75
@JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It's just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won't keep us away #lovejetblue
@JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
@JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits
@JetBlue I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE
@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :(
@JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
@JetBlue insane the craziness I've seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue
@JetBlue we are delayed, until he arrives
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert
@JetBlue whose performing at T5
@JetBlue flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed.
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@JetBlue yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can't do online. Thanks.
"@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs"
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
"@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help"
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage.
@JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on
"@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon"
"@JetBlue 
But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service."
"@JetBlue 
Apparently not."
@JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601
"@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to ""plan your trip page""
regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process
hint: the end of it"
@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
@JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it
@JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should
@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
@JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane.
@JetBlue just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? @PhD_Mama_
"@JetBlue, I normally ❤️ you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly"
@JetBlue @KyleJudah It doesn't matter who you directed me to. It's the principle of the matter. When I gate checked the stroller it was
@JetBlue 117 days maybe.
@JetBlue figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers
"@JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare."
@JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
"@JetBlue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol"
@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
@JetBlue should i continue?
@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
@JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect
@JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
@JetBlue busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
"@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not..."
@JetBlue please provide me your direct email for me to explain.
@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me
