@JetBlue Thanks for the quick reply! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't just my account :)
@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
@JetBlue here you go... Your napkins pretty much say it all! http://t.co/OxY1Jnpjm3
"“@JetBlue: @Ruth_Slobodin Why not? We'd sure love to see you, Ruth! #JustDoIt #YouKnowYouWantTo ;)” you know me too well 💘"
@JetBlue you don't need to cut services, charge more and give a better flying experience. That's why I use jet blue in the first place
@JetBlue Longing to look into the blue eyes. #firstlove

@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
"@JetBlue here in Austin I saw the water bottles &amp; snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! Im so Flight Booking Problems my next flight with you!"
@JetBlue no, they're too busy being awesome and trying to get us out ASAP. I'll deal.
@JetBlue thanks so much!! ❤️✨ very relaxing flight!
@JetBlue excellent. you guys are the best
@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I 💙 you!
@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ☕✈👍
@JetBlue awesome, thanks!
@JetBlue keep going back and forth with being able to board and then not. But great agents in savannah!
@JetBlue That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.
@JetBlue Vegas, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia so far! I'm a very frequent business traveler.
@JetBlue you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline!
@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly
@JetBlue:  Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)
"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)"
.@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my “only” airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :(
@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
@JetBlue thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA
Not your fault @JetBlue Social Media Awesome People. I know everyone is working hard to get us in our way.
@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
@JetBlue thanks
@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
