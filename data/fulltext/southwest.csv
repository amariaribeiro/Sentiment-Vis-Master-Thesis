@SouthwestAir Any idea when the winter advisory will be posted for ATL for tomorrow (2/25)?? I'd rather get to PHL tonight.
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2

@SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information?
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.

@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@SouthwestAir following. Thank you.

@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy

@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp
@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.

@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@SouthwestAir Why do you have to be 18 😭
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!
@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
@SouthwestAir 3 hours and 80 degree difference. Yes please!!  MHT TO MCO @sadie4406 http://t.co/MRAW3qDw4D
@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
@SouthwestAir still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!
@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
@SouthwestAir are 5 people there?
@SouthwestAir looks like Bellagio to me! Good luck people! See you at the show at Vinyl
“@SouthwestAir: Congrats to these fans who are seeing #DestinationDragons in L.A.! SLC, you're next! http://t.co/YcCITaeP3S” Thanks again SW
@SouthwestAir Can a pair of tickets waiting for me after my sports practice? I live here and definitely know where that is! @Imaginedragons
@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
@SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...
"@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say ""boo"" not book. booo."
@SouthwestAir #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove
@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it.
@SouthwestAir  I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
"@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding"
@SouthwestAir Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip?
@SouthwestAir best airline 👌
@southwestair #netneutrality Nice to see you prioritize Internet traffic to your own streaming service over other web sites!
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@SouthwestAir  Northern California coast http://t.co/nm4VNNF8Kb
@SouthwestAir hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@southwestair watching planes do their thing https://t.co/iItoJhUIKH
@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@SouthwestAir continues to prove to be the best airlines 💪
"@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons"
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
@SouthwestAir thanks!!
@SouthwestAir Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays
"@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?"
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
"@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
@SouthwestAir Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero.  Got my husband back thru security to retrieve his cellphone in Austin. Terry (#85832) You Rock!
@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best
"@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free."
@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas 😉
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir A+ to the Safety Dos and Don'ts Announcer. Flight 651 from Midway (MDW) to Pittsburgh (PIT)!
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
@SouthwestAir another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!!
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
@SouthwestAir Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you!
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@SouthwestAir understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified.
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
"@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to ""listen to the intercom better""."
@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@SouthwestAir they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood
@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail
@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
"@SouthwestAir Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;)"
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
@SouthwestAir open seating is like an open marriage, there's so much love for strangers!
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@SouthwestAir : thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled?
"@SouthwestAir we checked in right at 24hr mark. Boarding C group with kids ages 6&amp;8 dnt want to be split. What sld we do?"
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir @matthewebel And this is why I love flying Southwest. Excellent service, and you don't take yourselves too seriously!
@SouthwestAir @coachGS what's even better is the price changed in the 2 minutes since I talked to the lady and they still honored the cheap1

"@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?"
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
"@SouthwestAir 
How do I get a companion pass??? Thanks,  Lin S"
@SouthwestAir  Just sent DM. Thanks for your attentiveness to this matter.
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.

@SouthwestAir have sent you a DM with the details. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is, I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC

@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir loved it!
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
@SouthwestAir I am in, let's do this!
"@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)"
@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016

@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together?
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"
@SouthwestAir crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
"@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕"
@southwestair yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done

@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
@southwestair Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@SouthwestAir Free TV watching Daytona 500! #Boss http://t.co/SbGBN7oUXy
@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
@SouthwestAir thank you!!
@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
@SouthwestAir especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper
@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
"@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?"
@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!
@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again

"@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous"
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@SouthwestAir got it.  Next time I will know about paying extra to make the A Line.
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??

@SouthwestAir Please explain to reps, ignoring a technical issue and passing the buck is not a good business model. Lucky limited to 140
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@SouthwestAir So that's what happens when your power level goes over 9,000... feet in the air.

@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM.
@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won 😭🙏
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5.
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@SouthwestAir Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx!
@SouthwestAir sent DM
@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.

@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???

@SouthwestAir it is working on a different device, though. Any help is appreciated.
@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.

@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
"@SouthwestAir Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU"
@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@SouthwestAir do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou
@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail
@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
"@SouthwestAir would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;)"
@SouthwestAir appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers!
@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!
"@SouthwestAir I notice that there are separate buttons for ""guitar"" and actual ""music"" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this."
@SouthwestAir give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything 😆
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
@SouthwestAir Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer
"@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple ""no"" would do; I just want to know. :)"
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@SouthwestAir a nice trip back home after a looong vaca 😊🌴 http://t.co/9TRvfnCedL
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@SouthwestAir It was the usually excellent SWA flight!
@SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.
@SouthwestAir Jason (108639) at Gate #3 in SAN made my afternoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!
@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline
"@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!"
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk
@SouthwestAir have to be honest, didn't expect a fast response, thank you!  Off to #Chiberia we go!
@SouthwestAir Making Miracles again! The customer service department gave me by far one of the friendliest phone calls ever. #wheelsup
@SouthwestAir Already signed up!  Thanks!  Looking forward to trying the Southwest experience.
@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND
@SouthwestAir good to know. Perhaps it was execution then.
@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
@SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.

@SouthwestAir you only hear about the bad things. Flying the last to weekends, the flights and crews were awesome. Thank you. 👍👍
@SouthwestAir Sorry to spam, it would just be so awesome to see @Imaginedragons in Vegas. Your help would be absolutely amazing.

@SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn't let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice
@SouthwestAir @MichaelBColeman - thanks for making new direct flight to San Francisco.
@SouthwestAir the crew of 4649 has been great to us today. Traveling from Ft. Lauderdale to Louisville with 2 kids 7 and under. Thanks!✈️✈️
@SouthwestAir will you please work out a contract with @triflight to offer service there..
@SouthwestAir please reply to my DM ♥️
@SouthwestAir you're going to compensate us for the two plane changes in Atlanta right?
@SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
@SouthwestAir Roger wilco.
@SouthwestAir How do I enter passport information on an existing reservation before check in?
"@SouthwestAir Any way you can help with entry to Vegas event? My Boyfriend &amp; I have been @Imaginedragons fans since 2009. They are awesome!"
@SouthwestAir nvm, gate said they're holding connections. Thanks for quick response!
@SouthwestAir to the rescue. Sundown in Chicago. Next stop San Antonio! http://t.co/rQBpmwETtq
@SouthwestAir yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven't boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge
@SouthwestAir Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There's zero non-stop in Aug and Sept
@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
@SouthwestAir has some of the best airfare prices! Gotta LUV them :)
@SouthwestAir my Flt was delayed, scheduled to miss my connection, can I get some help? 8HH4P2
@SouthwestAir thank you, will do
@SouthwestAir I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same.

@SouthwestAir :( Thanks for the opportunity...
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you
@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir yes please
@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ✈️😃👍
@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
@SouthwestAir I'm excited too, but perhaps you could scale your excitement back by a few weeks...
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons please help me and my best friend get tickets to #DestinationDragons we have so much to thank them for....

"@SouthwestAir thanks a lot for sending a ""special deal"" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners"
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
@SouthwestAir Don't worry, you will! :-)
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
@SouthwestAir do you have any flights from NAS-BWI ton March 23?
@SouthwestAir for my travel I see bz class and get away are sld out. Anytime is available . How do I know how many anytime are available?
@SouthwestAir Thanks I get that. It looks like all BWI-SJD services stops after Aug 7. Is that the case? I cant find one date with flights.
@SouthwestAir can I get some luv with a fallow?
@SouthwestAir thanks for your attention, I've been flying southwest for 3 years and haven't had this issue in the past.
@SouthwestAir do you have a pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in Atlanta?! I'd love to go! #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@SouthwestAir please help me get tickets to the @Imaginedragons club show in Atlanta?! #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir Do you perhaps have a pair to the Atlanta show? #prettyplease
"@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another ""go-to"" airliner"

"@SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight.."
@SouthwestAir yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent.
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..
@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation.
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
@SouthwestAir This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest

@SouthwestAir great news for @PortColumbusCMH today. Finally, Columbus' top unserved market will have flights.
@SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route?
"@SouthwestAir is really stepping up their ""service""🐩 http://t.co/VQTyza6Mzu"
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
@SouthwestAir are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I'm looking at 3/19-3/23
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
"@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!"
"@SouthwestAir I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I'm a SW fan &amp; LOVE your service!"

@SouthwestAir I got a phishing email claiming to be from Southwest. I can forward to you if you'd like to investigate.
@SouthwestAir unfortunately no, it's my lack of status that's the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets
@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp

@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
"@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ☀️&amp; races in Daytona"
@SouthwestAir aww thanks!! Other than that, love it!

@SouthwestAir if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you
@SouthwestAir I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
@SouthwestAir amazing service by your SW stewardesses! From den to Cun and from CUN to Atl and atl to lax. Thank u!

@SouthwestAir Sorry! Thought I did. It's done now.
@SouthwestAir No I have not.
@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
"@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore."
@SouthwestAir OH MY GOSH SERIOUSLY?! you just made my day, week, year!!! No one will appreciate this more than me!!!
@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭
@SouthwestAir when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th???
@SouthwestAir pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job!
@SouthwestAir Ahhhh! Sorry, just followed.
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons
@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!
@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.
@SouthwestAir I left something on a plane landing at Midway last night because I am a responsible adult -- got a number for me to call? TY!
"@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?"
@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight.
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your time!
@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
@SouthwestAir In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address.
@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.
"@SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time."
@SouthwestAir Finally got me home #BNASnow
"@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow."
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir looking for cheap flight to vegas
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
"@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do"
@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
@SouthwestAir took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines
@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.

@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
“@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
@SouthwestAir neveind, it's been found and on its way. Thanks for making the process so painless
@SouthwestAir What are your services? What promotion you have at the moment? #ModeloDeNegocio #innovation #innovacion #BusinessModel
"@SouthwestAir my bag was Late Flight-checked and put on a different flight from OAK-&gt;MSY. Having troubles tracking it down. Any help?"
@SouthwestAir @JohnWayneAir Thank you both very much!!
@SouthwestAir you are the #Official airlines of #DivadaPouch aka #ThePoopQueen http://t.co/XXY2d2iMnP
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to get home to Nashville. I've been stuck in Dallas 2 days will my flight get out in the morning
@SouthwestAir Once again, I was able to change my flight without any fees... oh and the two free checked bags.  Best airline ever.
@SouthwestAir A wonderfully nice agent in Austin helped us out. Wish I remembered her name to give proper kudos.
@SouthwestAir hot stewardess flipped me off
"@SouthwestAir where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!!"
@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
@SouthwestAir snow forecasted for Raleigh NC tomorrow night. Need to know if there's a plan to reschedule flights into RDU Wednesday night
@SouthwestAir I need some help with a reservation
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
"@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a ""baggage error"" #sarcasm"
@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer

@SouthwestAir has the best customer service!
@SouthwestAir big thanks to your team. family emerg, same day ticket, experience was excellent. 1st time flying with yall, not my last!
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab
@SouthwestAir - total win!! Happy 7th bday on intercom, chocoLate Flight kisses, and a chance to hand out snacks.Thank you. http://t.co/NKloZcNtto
@SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@SouthwestAir thanks for your excellent response time and assistance! All set :)
@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@SouthwestAir can't wait! Thanks for the response!❤️
@SouthwestAir Got it covered. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
@SouthwestAir thank you for your help resolving my problem Shannon ROCKS - even though Rhonda didn't !!
@SouthwestAir thanks!! We will see what happens!!
.@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods.
"@SouthwestAir can u better define the ""plus one smaller type"" item on carry on requirements?.. small backpacks?"
@SouthwestAir you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines.
@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!
@SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf# FVF9YW  SWRR# 298033455
@SouthwestAir I'm Flight Booking Problems a flight to Vegas. Any good promo codes??

@SouthwestAir all good now. Going to make it to Boston on time. I'm actually on your wifi right now
@SouthwestAir  you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts!
@SouthwestAir thanks for your assistance..you guys ROCK!!💯
@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
@SouthwestAir Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
@SouthwestAir Hey yea I got thru...everything is good now (well, in 7-10 days when the voucher goes through)  Appreciate it!
@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
"@SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from ""uneventful"" with heavy (panic) breaking to"
@SouthwestAir can you outline the policies for both scenarios?
@SouthwestAir who should I contact about a missing Rapid Rewards credit?
@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@SouthwestAir @travelportland welcome to Portland. Sun, Mt hood and Southwest. http://t.co/y3SAHVX3Zk
@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM

@SouthwestAir still haven't been able to get through, thanks for responding
@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn’t a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
@SouthwestAir has the winner for #DestinationDragons been announced yet? If not when will they be??
@SouthwestAir On my flight today from RSW to GRR I was able to snag a free SW Agent to check for me. It looks like we are (finally) all set.

@SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
@SouthwestAir though I work for another major airline,  I LOVE your Black history month commercial. I Thank you.
@SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
@SouthwestAir Black History Commercial is really sweet. Well done.

"@SouthwestAir I understand. Wonderful ""Miriam"" in customer service who was able to reroute me... Got any rental car discounts?"
@SouthwestAir not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities.
@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.

@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to add a Known Traveler Number to an existing reservation online?  If not, why not?

@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
@SouthwestAir Just sent you a DM with the details.
@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this

"@SouthwestAir Another great flight &amp; crew, Las Vegas-Chicago #3397. Thanks!"

@SouthwestAir thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though.
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers
"@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA"

"@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got ""unspecified errors"""
@SouthwestAir @PaytonTaylor129 I love Southwest and Payton Taylor!

@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@SouthwestAir they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight?
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir I absolutely will. Where can I send it?
@SouthwestAir no worries. You're doing the best u can. Already Cancelled Flighted my biz trip. Still $LUV you! -RR 1079871763
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.

"@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
"@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???"
"@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the ""no charge"" part."
@SouthwestAir can someone help me set up a callback today?
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold

@SouthwestAir Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter? thanks you.
@SouthwestAir Thank you.  Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter?
@SouthwestAir the 5:50 is sold out too?
@SouthwestAir myself and 2 others
@SouthwestAir can you follow me? Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't rebook online, been on hold for 2 hours.  Would love to DM flight info. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!
@SouthwestAir 45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice

@SouthwestAir trying to fly out of Nashville tomorrow. How is it looking?
@SouthwestAir do you think the flights out of Nashville will be Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago.
@SouthwestAir  Thank you.
"@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: ""Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online."" #FUSTURATED"

"@SouthwestAir I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours."
@SouthwestAir Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance?
@SouthwestAir Can you link the article where it says the routes and what times the routes are likely to be? Like TUL-DAL 1:00PM - 7 None

@SouthwestAir Beautiful, thanks a ton!
@SouthwestAir tried to rebook online but it says that I have to pay $200 for difference in price. Please help
@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
@SouthwestAir can't update my flight online bc it's been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold.
@SouthwestAir Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back.
@southwestair - kind of early but any idea when dates through the first week of sept will come available?
@SouthwestAir the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
"@SouthwestAir been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives?"
@SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today?
@SouthwestAir husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can't confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts!
@SouthwestAir thanks do yall expect to be operational tomorrow out of Nashville?
@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
@SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home.
@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
"@SouthwestAir allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared"
@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
@SouthwestAir Guys, we've got to do something about the inability to check in online for international  flight that has... (1/2)
@SouthwestAir Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :(
@SouthwestAir won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone
@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@SouthwestAir nice work on the update!
@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
