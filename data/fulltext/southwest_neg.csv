@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
"@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!"
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
"@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care"
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
"@SouthwestAir my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset."
@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
"@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again."
@SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤
@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@SouthwestAir they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@SouthwestAir thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg.
@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
@SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help?
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
@SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@SouthwestAir trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help?
@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
"@SouthwestAir Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, ""Unable to price"". Please help!"
@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.
@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ
@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again.
@SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2
@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
@SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed.
@SouthwestAir freezing in the plane
@SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr
@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page
@SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information?
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
"@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED"
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
"@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?"
@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
@SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze
@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@SouthwestAir mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook
@SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30
@SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash
@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625
@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy.
@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?
@SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web?
@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone.
@SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
@SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
"@SouthwestAir I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations."
@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay
@SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight.
@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
@SouthwestAir when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM?
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
"@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong"
@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f
@SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
"@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me"
"@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear"
@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night.
"@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might ""know"" but don't show it."
@SouthwestAir darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure?
"@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. 

#filmjobnoequipment 
#nowarmclothes"
@SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment
@SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
@SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson
@SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
@SouthwestAir making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah
@SouthwestAir we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don't let them travel
@SouthwestAir won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
@SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
@SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.
@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh?
@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@SouthwestAir oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks!
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
@SouthwestAir prove it
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
@SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
"@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding"
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
"@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?"
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
"@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail
@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|
@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
@SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here?
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB
@SouthwestAir Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I'm being told that I will, but I never get email/call back
@SouthwestAir pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don't want to fly with anyone else 😩😫😢
@SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward
"@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?"
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
@SouthwestAir #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I'm watching free TV it works but won't hardly access any websites - including your own.
@SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds.
"@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, ""well, that system is about dead."" She didn't understand"
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
"@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)"
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
"@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕"
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
"@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2
Paid for early bird and sat in back"
@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
"@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?"
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again
@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.
"But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united."
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
"@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!"
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@SouthwestAir everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1
@SouthwestAir How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on.
@SouthwestAir wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made.
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
"@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous"
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??
@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained

@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?

@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler

@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
"@SouthwestAir your ""complimentary"" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!"
@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed

"@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove"
@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
"@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali"
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
@SouthwestAir I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous.
@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
"@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE."
@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.

@SouthwestAir - I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?

@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?

@SouthwestAir  at fort launder dale and the gate agent can't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone...ridiculous
@SouthwestAir so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline?
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight won't refund me and told me 2 call customer service n been holding for 30 minutes still waitin #BadService
@SouthwestAir I'm going to need you to answer your phones. Being on hold for an hour isn't okay.
@SouthwestAir almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
@SouthwestAir Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook

@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
@southwestair Landed an hour Late Flight from IND to DEN, and 40+ min Late Flightr, our bags are not here. Not cool.
@SouthwestAir Horrible experience ever with airline..Have to reconsider any future flights. Customer service ... http://t.co/EczHcmM5vi
@SouthwestAir wanting a ⭐️ for the ✈️ finding the gate. No apology or exp. All good, I'm sure connecting flight leaving SAC will be chill!
@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city.
"@SouthwestAir cool the plane you said is ours that just left the terminal for a diff city? She a cold betch for ""flying the friendly skies"""
@SouthwestAir flight to San Diego is delayed per usual.. take me home!
@SouthwestAir every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?
@SouthwestAir I have a voucher w swa that expires 4/10. An extension would be a lot of luv
@SouthwestAir not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service.
"@SouthwestAir Loved one's flight ATL to IND Cancelled Flightled due to ""ice in Indy"". Sitting here in Indy, it is bone dry. Tomorrow 4-6"" of snow."
@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight and I'm stranded in St. Louis. Not sure what to do. No other flight until tomorrow. Am I to sleep in airpt
@SouthwestAir - stuck on the runway, again. Delayed on Wednesday. Not a good way to take care of your loyal customers.
"@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy"
@SouthwestAir my parents flight frm STL2ATL Cancelled Flighted 2nite. When's the next one out?!
@SouthwestAir well my mom called earlier and you guys had her on hold for close to an hour

@SouthwestAir http://t.co/tTXRSyNLxr doesn't work on my flight. Just fyi.
@SouthwestAir I would die if I got tickets to #DestinationDragons and you would be invited to my funeral
@SouthwestAir = easy and pleasant. @united = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
@SouthwestAir not sure I can trust a statement with that many small numbers above words. http://t.co/o3sRL1hfho
@SouthwestAir Late Flightly you've always been Late Flight! Please get back to the old #SWA!!
@SouthwestAir Totally sucks that my flights were weathered out of existence, but Stacy in Tucson helped with an overnight in Vegas!
@SouthwestAir are you guys alive? i've been on hold for 25 minutes and counting.....
@SouthwestAir Gary Kelly should be ashamed of himself running a corporation in this way
@SouthwestAir you guys just rip me off if I could Cancelled Flight every flight I had booked for my employees I  would Buyer beware
@SouthwestAir not if its travel Credit you used to buy and it expires on the day you find a lower rate
@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded.
"@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flights arrivals &amp; departures in Nashville as of 5pm. That and more weather headlines @ 4pm #LiveOnFOX17 #FebruaryFreezeFox17"
"@SouthwestAir I was on hold for 30 minutes &amp; no one knows how to win these tickets that you're still handing out? #DestinationDragons"
@SouthwestAir  after 38 minutes on the phone I'm given another number to call now still on hold with them. http://t.co/1ZT2kEe8up

"@SouthwestAir well I HAD a car &amp; free place 2 stay had I known Unacceptable treatment from Spvsr. Sally in Cleveland. #Disappointed"
@SouthwestAir and this asshole cut in front of me. Your system blows. http://t.co/7ujt8VTCpa
@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
@SouthwestAir  over 15 minutes without talking to a human at what point would you recommend I call @AmericanAir http://t.co/ysqbVq6Mgb
"@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?"
@SouthwestAir No thanks. After those 25+ minutes someone did eventually help us and took care of it.
@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems.
@SouthwestAir one of my bags didn't make it to my destination. I have the claim ticket. Any way to help out with a status on the location?
Includes @KCIAirport “@SouthwestAir: Inclement weather may impact scheduled service in. ReFlight Booking Problems options available: http://t.co/KeyrpFlHil”
@SouthwestAir yes but not with out an attitude and nasty comment

"@SouthwestAir#4569 Cancelled Flightled, had to get refund. Cancelled Flightlations happen. But the 25+ min phone wait &amp; painful music unacceptable. Come on..."
@SouthwestAir 2 1/2 hours Late Flight, but I made it to sf! Maybe you can help me get on an earlier flight on Sunday :)
@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
@SouthwestAir did you Cancelled Flight ALL flights into BNA today??? #needtogethome
@SouthwestAir huge problem with someone whose ticket was Cancelled Flighted mid trip. Can you DM?
@SouthwestAir flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir?
@SouthwestAir Please explain to reps, ignoring a technical issue and passing the buck is not a good business model. Lucky limited to 140
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@SouthwestAir Please start charging for carryon luggage. #CarryOnBagsSlowEverybodyDown
@SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience
@SouthwestAir will you please start offering services out of @triflight and @AshevilleAir to other airports.. Have to drive 3-4 hrs to use u
@SouthwestAir Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn't do work if I wanted to.  Never again.
"@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human"
@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model.
@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
@SouthwestAir y airline I fly with, but haven't seen anything like this yet!
"@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice"
@SouthwestAir - 800 is not int'l friendly
@SouthwestAir 4-4 in horrible customer service. Empty seats in early flight wantcharge me double to get home early instead the usual Late Flight
@SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly.
@SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler
@SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey
"@SouthwestAir what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl?"
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
@SouthwestAir If you could get me on the 12:15 flight! My 10:10 has been delayed until 1:05.
@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out.
@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
@SouthwestAir FJBFSC  all I need is receipt showing the 776.20 charge I have on my Amex not the 656.xx that I keep getting sent
@SouthwestAir what do I need to do when TSA pre doesn't show for a flight of mine?
"@SouthwestAir  getting the run around today with customer service &amp; disconnected customer relations # given twice. Help!!!"
@SouthwestAir have been doing that for hours already
@SouthwestAir After flying Delta this week, GoGo was so good. The tweet I sent you didn't even send until we landed - that's how bad it was
@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!
@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5.
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
"@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP"
@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.
@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???
@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.
@SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!!
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
@SouthwestAir luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I'm going to get spoiled.
@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue
@SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help!
"@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????
@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated
"@SouthwestAir Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day
#annoyed"
@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
@SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou
@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail
@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
"@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple ""no"" would do; I just want to know. :)"
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
"@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!"
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk
@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND
@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
@SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
@SouthwestAir lets chat about flights to and from BWI and the Carolina area... Can a girl get break? I've had to resort to USAir 😖 2 a day?!
@SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn't let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice
@SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
@SouthwestAir Roger wilco.
@SouthwestAir yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven't boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge
@SouthwestAir Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There's zero non-stop in Aug and Sept
@SouthwestAir my Flt was delayed, scheduled to miss my connection, can I get some help? 8HH4P2
@SouthwestAir I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same.
@SouthwestAir flight # 317
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
"@SouthwestAir my trip is a month away...why do you consider it ""around the corner""? Is that a setting I can change?"
@SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail

@SouthwestAir you're killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh
@SouthwestAir almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
"@SouthwestAir experiencing the worst customer service ever currently. Waited for CS rep, then put ""on hold"" but actually was hung up on."
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@SouthwestAir reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list?
"@SouthwestAir @saianel You could have just said ""We don't know"""
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@SouthwestAir can't DM you without you following me...
@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(
@SouthwestAir Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together.
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
"@SouthwestAir thanks a lot for sending a ""special deal"" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners"
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
"@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another ""go-to"" airliner"
"@SouthwestAir What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 😑"
@SouthwestAir A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives???
@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
"@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter"
@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
"@SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight.."
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..
@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation.
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
@SouthwestAir Why doesn't mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account.
@SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route?
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
"@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful"
@SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice
@SouthwestAir I already follow you and can't DM because u need to follow me back
@SouthwestAir, rude customer svc, won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice
"@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw."
@SouthwestAir having trouble reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site isn't working.
@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
@SouthwestAir @jlittle100 Double up with this comment. PHL to anywhere South Florida is GONE GONE GONE. Hello US Air
@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
"@SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead."
@SouthwestAir I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
@SouthwestAir nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor
"@SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. 😔 why...so... few...direct...flights?"
"@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback."
@SouthwestAir great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. 😒👎
@SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?
@SouthwestAir Is my friend lucky enough to see #DestinationDragons live on his birthday? He's been a fan for years @thirty_lives
@SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
@SouthwestAir is main supporter of play where Jesus is portrayed as homosexual partner of Judas and who performs a “gay wedding” #boycott
@SouthwestAir you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.
@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
"@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ☀️&amp; races in Daytona"
@SouthwestAir Learn how to give folks on multiple flights the same day boarding position at least if you can't give them  boarding passes.
@SouthwestAir I'm getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas....
@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.😭
@SouthwestAir how it feels on flight 4251 http://t.co/JM8gQ1KGrF
@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
"@SouthwestAir love how ""friendly"" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes"
@SouthwestAir hates guitar players. Chgd for oversize AND extra bag on my acoustic guitar. Epic fail.
"@SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!"
@SouthwestAir I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :(
@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
@SouthwestAir We've been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I'm telling Herb.
@SouthwestAir had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
@SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :(
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
@SouthwestAir I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading.
"@SouthwestAir today you sporadically changed my flight departure 5 times &amp; left two hours Late Flight. Uncharacteristic of u http://t.co/TXhYJ40llG"
@SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room.
"@SouthwestAir have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is ""No"". :("
@SouthwestAir could care more about their customer, if there is a reasonable request :(
@SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
@SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it's just on the nxt flight up. I've got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I'll just turn my sweatshirt inside out
@SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything

@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
@SouthwestAir @LeeAnnHealey I was all, yeah sale fares! I got places to fly! Oh damn, right, I live where SWA doesn't fly. #why
@SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you
"@SouthwestAir lost my sunglasses &amp; case on a flight 3933 last night - is there a lost &amp; found?"
@SouthwestAir your WiFi is shit. fix that up before I jump out of the closest bloody fucking emergency exit.
@SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal.
@SouthwestAir alas, it was pretty full so we had to entertain ourselves with witty repartee ...
@SouthwestAir I am trying to book another flight and apply my credits that I had from another flight but I can't find them.
@SouthwestAir So frustrated with my experience with #Southwest. 18 hours trapped in Denver bc of mechanical problems. #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@SouthwestAir we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don't get put on a flight.
"@SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62"", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn't very clear to me."
@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
"@SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at 
Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?"
"@SouthwestAir pls help me get this resolved &amp; reimbursement made.  gracias, rico; pls send me private msg with phone number or email address"
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred line phone wait was 15 minutes. I hung up, not feeling A-list-ey!
@SouthwestAir How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card!
@SouthwestAir TSA Pre isn't showing up on my boarding passes and I've followed all of the steps. Please help.
@SouthwestAir if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you
@SouthwestAir I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
@SouthwestAir bad weather and multiple Cancelled Flighted flights has us all scared!  Noted for next time.
@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
@SouthwestAir doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG
@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?
"@SouthwestAir #worstthingever 2days Late Flightr our lost bag was fedexed somewhere. Do you know where cause we don't &amp; it was delivered somewhere"
@SouthwestAir how do i know that my information is not found on other people's account?  I can see someone else's reservation, rr # and trip
@SouthwestAir I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour
@SouthwestAir Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international
@SouthwestAir looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone's itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight http://t.co/BApE6RuMNE
@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
@SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you
@SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather.
5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS”
@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
@SouthwestAir it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!
@SouthwestAir it was this one but looks like the problem is now fixed. https://t.co/CFI1E3KXA9
".@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate"
@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
@SouthwestAir tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it.
@SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend.
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
@SouthwestAir it's ok...I forgive you guys.
@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
@SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available?
@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
"@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on"
@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
@SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing.
@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
@SouthwestAir after a long wait of over an hour my mother's bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help
@SouthwestAir when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us.
@SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
@SouthwestAir No I have not.
@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
"@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore."
@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons
@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!
@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
"@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?"
@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay
@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight.
@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.
"@SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time."
"@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow."
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
"@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do"
@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.
@SouthwestAir when will you be accepting reservations past August 7?
"@SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said ""well i was Late Flight"""
@SouthwestAir I just sent a screen shot of the incident report.
"@SouthwestAir I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :("
@SouthwestAir Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed. Any details on why?
@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
@SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh
@SouthwestAir will you please tell me if I'll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I've been tryin for 3 days now to leave
@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
“@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
"@SouthwestAir where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!!"
@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
"@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a ""baggage error"" #sarcasm"
@SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit
@southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID
@SouthwestAir when you're on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab
@SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
.@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods.
@SouthwestAir you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines.
@SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf# FVF9YW  SWRR# 298033455
@SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!
@SouthwestAir  you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts!
@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
@SouthwestAir Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
"@SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from ""uneventful"" with heavy (panic) breaking to"
@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM
@SouthwestAir not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18.
@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn’t a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
"@SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?"
@SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
@SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
@SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag
@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again
@SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight. I drove down and it wasnt. I just drove down for a second time and they were
@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
@SouthwestAir Im just praying you get me home alive
@SouthwestAir I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next @AmericanAir #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
"@SouthwestAir what's up with these delays?! Throw some priority boarding my way &amp; I'll forgive you!! 👍 #southwest #southwestairlines"
@SouthwestAir needed my flight info so I can add my rapid rewards to my flight ... First time I have flown with SW - won't do it again #mad
"@SouthwestAir I keep getting disconnected after choosing the option ""unused travel funds"" on your automated customer service line! SOS"
@SouthwestAir Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn’t Late Flight.
@SouthwestAir Not your finest moment in Boston right now!

@SouthwestAir thanks! I expected a wait... Just not that long. :)
@SouthwestAir understand weather is an issue but on time Cancelled Flighted reinstated Cancelled Flighted with hardly any updates and doing nothing for me= :(

@SouthwestAir done messed up now!!! I have planned a trip to #CostaRica for pennies!!! #VacaTime ✈️💺

@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
@SouthwestAir 4/9/14, I need to fly from GSP to DSM, but claims there's no sched. avail.  I can book separately, but why not together?

@SouthwestAir Having some trouble checking in. Can you please add me so I can DM you

@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all.
"@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay."
@SouthwestAir not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities.
@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
@SouthwestAir been on the phone for about an hour waiting..can you please answer, Thank You!  #notcool
@SouthwestAir she's still stranded in DC. Sat until 3:30am with 100 other kids. They were starving, and exhausted.
@SouthwestAir flight #211pilot spilled his tea on the radio! Yay for delays! Almost an hour now!
@SouthwestAir I just sent it over
@SouthwestAir used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst
@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
"@SouthwestAir My brother &amp; his girlfriend’s flight Cancelled Flightled 3 times, now leaving 72 hours Late Flight and dropping letter grades at school. Help?"
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day
@SouthwestAir missing out on over 6,000 points in one account. They're now spread over four assuming I create accounts for them
@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm....
@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
@SouthwestAir Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir I recommend upgrading your IVR and using call back, email, and texting from a know caller.
@SouthwestAir an entire flight of luggage missing at #dca.  Over an hour and nobody knows anything.
@SouthwestAir @CBSsoxfan you get to hold? called twice only to be kicked off.calls 3-6 #phonedied #AListpreferred http://t.co/1TZZ0vbMbS
@SouthwestAir why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today?
"@SouthwestAir - I have spent 87 minutes (and counting) on hold w/ you today. After first 48 minutes, I gave up. Trying again &amp; on 43rd min."
@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers
"@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA"
@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
"@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got ""unspecified errors"""
@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@SouthwestAir they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight?
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
"@SouthwestAir Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN"
@SouthwestAir I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
"@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
"@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???"
"@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the ""no charge"" part."
@SouthwestAir can someone help me set up a callback today?
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold

@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!

@SouthwestAir kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500
@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago.
"@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: ""Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online."" #FUSTURATED"

@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
