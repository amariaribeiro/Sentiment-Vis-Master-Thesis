@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)

@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?
@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.

@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.
@united can you send me another confirmation email?
@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant
@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!
@united Hi again, any updates here?
@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.

@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?

"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere

@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
Thx! Stand by! “@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH”
@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?
@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!
@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@united all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep
@united Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you :)
