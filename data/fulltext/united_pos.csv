@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!

@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated.
@united @parryaftab done thnx
@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family
@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir
@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
"@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well."
@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!

@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
@united thank you!
@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off
@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍

"@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x"
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
@united it's amazing really.
@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
@united Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew, service on both legs. THANKS

@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)
@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
